	<div className="pages-paragraph">Welcome to my (currently under development) site. On these pages you'll find some of work across a variety of disciplines, and some other things I just find interesting. Unless it's a link to an external blog, everything on this site was developed/created/shot/filmed/edited enitrely by me. At the moment, this site is developed entirely in React then published via a Bash script that runs Python to update the media location and tags before syncing with S3 so the site is available to you. Feel free to take a look around at any of the pictures or videos on here, and feel free to contact me at the info in the footer. Thanks</div>

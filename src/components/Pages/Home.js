	<div className="pages-paragraph">Welcome to my site (which as you can see is currently under development). On these pages you'll find some of my work and hobbies across a variety of disciplines, and some other things I just find interesting. Unless a link to an external blog, everything on this site was developed created, shot, filmed, and/or edited by me. This site is developed in React, media locations are updated via Python scripts, then it's published out to S3. Please take a look around and feel free to contact me at the info in the footer with questions or comments on anything.</div>
